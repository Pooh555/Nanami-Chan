<p>The STT models are located in 
    <a href="https://github.com/Pooh555/Nanami-Chan/tree/main/models/src/main/assets" target="_blank">/models/src/main/assets
  </a>
  , and the code responsible for it is located in 
  <a href="https://github.com/Pooh555/Nanami-Chan/tree/main/app/src/main/java/com/nanami/stt" target="_blank">/app/src/main/java/com/nanami/stt

  - Service initialization.
  - Requesing microphone permission.
  - Conversion of speech to text
  - GET a response from the server.
  - Manage conversation history and model's memory.
  - Service termination</p>
