<p>This section describes the usage and development of speech-to-text (STT) implemented in this project.</p>

<h2 align="left">Information</h2>

<p>The STT models are located in 
    <a href="https://elevenlabs.io/app/voice-library" target="_blank">Elevenlabs's voice library
  </a>
  , and the code responsible for it is located in 
  <a href="https://github.com/Pooh555/Nanami-Chan/tree/main/app/src/main/java/com/nanami/tts" target="_blank">/app/src/main/java/com/nanami/tts
  </a>
  .

  This code handles the conversion of text generated by the LLM to speech which will be played out loud. Some fundamental functions includes:

  - Service initialization.
  - POST a text to Elevenlab's server.
  - GET a response from Elevenlab's server.
  - Play the audio.
  - Service termination</p>
